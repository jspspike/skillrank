    <p><br>Sessions are how leaderboards are managed. Add the players who you would like to add matches with and generate matches for. You can always add players after the session is started.</p>
    <h6>Number of Games</h6>
    <p>The number of games that can be run concurrently (e.g number of fields, nets, boards). This is so the matchmaking system knows how matches should be generated at once.</p>
    <h6>Players per Team</h6>
    <p>Number of players on each team. This is so the matchmaking system knows how many players to put in a game. This limit will not affect match entry. Meaning even if Players per Team is set to 2, you could enter 3 players on the winners and 2 on the losers.</p>
    <h6>Matchmaking Stability</h6>
    <p>There is a random factor that allows the matchmaking system to generate matches deviating from the "optimal" matches. This is to allow players to play with a larger variety of players. Increase this value to make matches less random and closer to the "optimal" pairs.</p>
